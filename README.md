# PytorchLightningSnippet

This repo contains pytorch lightning snippets. I made this repo to understand better about pytorch lightning and answer to question people ask.

Snippets

- How to apply EMA? [ema.ipynb](ema.ipynb)
- How to manually calculate metric and use it after test done with ddp? [pl_ddp_loss.py](pl_ddp_loss.py)
- How to log using tensorboard? [pl_logger.py](pl_logger.py)
- How to log valid loss on step with ddp? [pl_ddp_on_step_loss.py](pl_ddp_on_step_loss.py)
- How to customize saving checkpoints? [pl_save_checkpoint.ipynb](pl_save_checkpoint.ipynb)
